# Babric Render Overhaul

This mod is fundamentally a complete failure, it's quite an invasive and challenging mod to implement, and the name also sucks.  
Basically focus all attention on [Nawt](https://github.com/jaquobia/Nawt), the shiny new toy that is *actually* compatible with most beta mods and has a good name.
